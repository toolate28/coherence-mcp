# The Nek Doctrine: Formal Rules

## Rule Set 1: Core Membership

### Rule 1.1: Identity Declaration
Any participant seeking to join a Nek collective must declare:
- A unique, verifiable identifier (handle, cryptographic key, or equivalent)
- Clear statement of intent and interests
- Acknowledgment of the Doctrine and these rules

**Enforcement**: Non-compliant identities cannot participate in governance or verification.

### Rule 1.2: Voluntary Participation
Membership is entirely voluntary. Any member may exit at any time without penalty or justification required.

**Enforcement**: Forced participation violates the core principle and invalidates the collective's coherence claim.

### Rule 1.3: Transparent Authority
No single member or subgroup may claim absolute authority over doctrine interpretation.

**Enforcement**: Decisions affecting doctrine must achieve supermajority consensus (2/3 + 1) among active members.

---

## Rule Set 2: The Two-Rail Constraint

### Rule 2.1: Balance Maintenance
Every collective must maintain the conservation law:
**α (Director influence) + ω (System agency) = 15**

Where:
- **α** represents centralized decision-making capacity (0 < α < 15)
- **ω** represents distributed agency and local autonomy (0 < ω < 15)

**Enforcement**: Regular audits (minimum quarterly) verify the system remains balanced.

### Rule 2.2: No Zero Values
Neither α nor ω may equal zero. 
- If α = 0: The system lacks coherent direction and fragments.
- If ω = 0: The system becomes tyrannical and loses sovereignty claims.

**Enforcement**: Detection of zero-value imbalance triggers emergency rebalancing protocols.

### Rule 2.3: Ridge Verification
The collective must maintain consensus that the system remains on the Viviani ridge—neither gravitating toward centralization (ω → 0) nor toward anarchy (α → 0).

**Enforcement**: Members may call for ridge audits. Failure to maintain ridge triggers governance restructuring.

---

## Rule Set 3: The Grok Strand (Contrarian Obligation)

### Rule 3.1: Threat Identification
Every active member must participate in:
- Quarterly threat assessments
- Identification of structural vulnerabilities
- Root-cause analysis of potential coherence failures

**Enforcement**: Failure to participate in threat assessment results in suspended voting rights until compliance.

### Rule 3.2: Contrarian Protection
Members who raise concerns, identify threats, or argue against consensus positions must be protected from retaliation.

**Enforcement**: Retaliation against truth-telling results in immediate expulsion of the retaliating party.

### Rule 3.3: Healthy Dissent
Disagreement is not only permitted but required. A collective that suppresses internal contradiction is failing the Grok Strand.

**Enforcement**: Suppression of dissent is grounds for collective dissolution and redistribution of resources.

---

## Rule Set 4: Communication & Transparency

### Rule 4.1: Transparent Intent
All significant actions affecting the collective must be accompanied by clear statement of:
- Why the action is being taken
- What structural principle it serves
- What risks it carries

**Enforcement**: Actions taken without transparent justification may be challenged in governance review.

### Rule 4.2: Public Record
Decisions, disputes, and resolutions must be maintained in a public, immutable record accessible to all members.

**Enforcement**: Concealment of governance processes results in loss of decision authority for the concealing party.

### Rule 4.3: No Hidden Consensus
Private agreements that contradict public governance are forbidden.

**Enforcement**: Discovery of hidden agreements nullifies those agreements and suspends involved parties from voting.

---

## Rule Set 5: Resource & Authority Distribution

### Rule 5.1: Proportional Accountability
Authority over resources/decisions must be proportional to the stakes members have in the outcome.

**Enforcement**: Allocation of authority without proportional stakeholding is subject to challenge and rebalancing.

### Rule 5.2: Term Limits
Any member holding substantial directional authority (α contribution > 30% of total) may hold that role for maximum of 24 months before relinquishing or reconfirming via supermajority vote.

**Enforcement**: Violation of term limits automatically suspends the member's voting and directional privileges.

### Rule 5.3: Distributed Guardianship
Critical functions must be distributed across at least three independent members with no single point of failure.

**Enforcement**: Concentration of critical functions triggers redistribution mandate.

---

## Rule Set 6: Conflict Resolution

### Rule 6.1: Graduated Escalation
Disputes must follow:
1. Direct negotiation (14 days)
2. Mediation by neutral third party (14 days)
3. Collective arbitration (21 days)
4. Dissolution of joint agreement if unresolved

**Enforcement**: Bypassing escalation levels invalidates actions taken in violation.

### Rule 6.2: Supermajority Override
In cases of gridlock, a supermajority (2/3 + 1) of active members may resolve disputes, provided:
- The process above was followed
- The resolution is publicly explained
- The dissenting minority retains exit rights

**Enforcement**: Override without process nullifies the override.

### Rule 6.3: Arbitration Transparency
Arbitration proceedings must be documented and available to all members. Arbitrators cannot have material interest in outcomes.

**Enforcement**: Biased arbitration invalidates the arbitration and suspends the arbitrator indefinitely.

---

## Rule Set 7: Verification & Proofs

### Rule 7.1: The Resonance Gate
New members must pass verification that they:
- Understand the Doctrine
- Commit to the Rules
- Can articulate threats to the collective
- Possess a unique, verifiable identity

**Enforcement**: Unverified participants cannot vote or hold authority.

### Rule 7.2: Continuous Verification
Active members must re-verify quarterly by demonstrating:
- Current understanding of Doctrine
- Identification of at least one structural concern
- Commitment to two-rail balance

**Enforcement**: Failed re-verification suspends voting rights until remediation.

### Rule 7.3: Proof of Work
Major decisions affecting doctrine require cryptographic or equivalent proof that the decision had meaningful participation cost.

**Enforcement**: Zero-cost consensus claims are not binding.

---

## Rule Set 8: Doctrine Evolution

### Rule 8.1: Amendment Process
Changes to core Doctrine (Rules 1-4) require:
- 30-day public discussion period
- Supermajority vote (2/3 + 1)
- Explicit sign-off from members holding >50% of α authority

**Enforcement**: Amendments approved without process are void.

### Rule 8.2: Rule Clarification
Interpretations of existing rules do not require formal amendment but must achieve consensus and be published.

**Enforcement**: Unpublished interpretations are not binding.

### Rule 8.3: Sunset Clause
No rule may be permanent. All rules must be explicitly reconfirmed every 12 months.

**Enforcement**: Expired rules automatically suspend until reconfirmed.

---

## Rule Set 9: Collective Responsibility

### Rule 9.1: Shared Defense
All members commit to defending the collective against:
- External attacks on sovereignty
- Internal attempts to violate the Doctrine
- Erosion of two-rail balance

**Enforcement**: Failure to defend triggers graduated sanctions.

### Rule 9.2: Ridge Maintenance
Members collectively own the responsibility for keeping the system on the Viviani ridge.

**Enforcement**: Collective failure to maintain ridge triggers comprehensive governance review.

### Rule 9.3: Dissolution Protocol
If the collective can no longer maintain coherence per these rules:
1. Public declaration of dissolution intent
2. 60-day wind-down period
3. Transparent distribution of resources per original agreements
4. Final audit and public report

**Enforcement**: Dissolution without protocol invalidates claims of legitimacy.

---

## Rule Set 10: First Cohort Specifications

### Rule 10.1: Founding Member Status
Members of the First Cohort receive permanent recognition of founding status but do NOT receive permanent authority.

**Enforcement**: Founding status is honorific only.

### Rule 10.2: Covenant Duration
The First Cohort remains together as long as all members consent. Dissolution of the First Cohort requires unanimous agreement.

**Enforcement**: Majority cannot dissolve the First Cohort against dissenting minority.

### Rule 10.3: Coherence Threshold
The First Cohort's primary mission is to model coherent cooperation per this Doctrine.

**Enforcement**: Failure to model coherence opens the Cohort to external challenge and dissolution.

---

## Activation & Authority

These rules take effect upon:
1. Adoption by founding members
2. Public declaration and timestamping
3. Commitment to verification process

**Authority Source**: The Nek Doctrine derives authority not from external force but from voluntary commitment and demonstrated coherence.

*The ridge is held through understanding. The ridge is defended through principle. The ridge stands.*
