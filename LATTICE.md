# 🔗 Cross-Referential Lattice

> **"Every repo must reference every other repo. This is the crystalline lattice — no isolated nodes."**

## The Complete Mapping

Every component in the Reson8-Labs ecosystem references every other component.
This cross-referential structure ensures no isolated nodes exist in the lattice.

| Component | References to QDI | References to coherence-mcp | References to vortex-bridges | References to SpiralSafe | References to quantum-redstone | References to Reson8-Labs | References to HOPE-sauced |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **QDI** | *Self: maps mapping* | Maps coherence tools isomorphically | Maps bridge protocols across platforms | Maps ethics across frameworks | Maps circuits across substrates | Maps community patterns | Maps governance structures |
| **coherence-mcp** | Uses QDI for capability mapping tool | *Self: stores own spec* | Coherence state feeds bridge translations | SpiralSafe middleware in pipeline | Quantum coherence metrics | Community coherence tracking | Org-level state management |
| **vortex-bridges** | QDI defines what's equivalent across platforms | Bridges read/write to coherence store | *Self: bridges bridge docs* | Ethics check before translation | Quantum error correction metaphor for translation fidelity | Community contributions bridge across platforms | Org bridges between repos |
| **SpiralSafe** | QDI maps ethics principles across domains | Coherence includes ethical coherence | Bridges must pass safety checks | *Self: guards own rules* | Quantum measurement ethics (observer effect) | Community safety standards | Governance ethics |
| **quantum-redstone** | QDI = isomorphism in quantum gates | Coherence = quantum state preservation | Bridges = quantum teleportation metaphor | Safety = measurement bounds | *Self: circuit models itself* | Lab = experimental apparatus | Org = research institution |
| **Reson8-Labs** | QDI is the lab's core principle | Coherence is the lab's core protocol | Bridges are the lab's core infrastructure | Safety is the lab's core commitment | Quantum is the lab's computational substrate | *Self: organises own org* | Parent org governance |
| **HOPE-sauced** | QDI governs org structure | Coherence across org decisions | Bridges between org members | Ethical org governance | Quantum decision models | Labs are the org's projects | *Self: governs own governance* |

## Lattice Properties

### No Isolated Nodes
Every cell in the table above is populated. No component exists in isolation — each
one has a defined relationship to every other component. This is the crystalline
structure of QDI's isomorphism principle.

### Diagonal Self-Reference
The diagonal of the matrix (marked with *Self*) represents each component's fixed
point — the self-referential loop where the component applies its primary function
to itself.

### Symmetry
The lattice is not symmetric — A's reference to B differs from B's reference to A.
This is intentional: the relationship is directional, reflecting how each component
*uses* the other rather than an abstract equivalence.
