# 🌀 User Workflow Guide v1

> **"From the constraints, gifts. From the spiral, safety."**

Welcome to your personal coherence journey! 🎉 This guide helps you navigate the SpiralSafe ecosystem with confidence and joy.

---

## 📖 Overview

The coherence-mcp workflow empowers you to:
- **Analyze** your content for coherence patterns
- **Track** decisions with full transparency  
- **Transition** through validated phases safely

Think of it as your quantum dashboard for meaningful work—each step builds on the last, spiraling upward toward clarity.

## 🏗️ Two Layers of Understanding

### Layer 1: Foundation (What You See)

The **visible layer** includes the tools you directly interact with:

| Tool | Purpose | Your Benefit |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `wave_analyze` | Coherence detection | Know your content quality instantly |
| `bump_validate` | Handoff safety | Ensure smooth transitions |
| `atom_track` | Decision trails | Never lose context |

### Layer 2: Depth (What Powers You)

The **invisible layer** works behind the scenes:

- **Fibonacci weighting**: Patterns emerge naturally (1→2→3→5→8)
- **Pilot wave guidance**: Predictive coherence optimization
- **Golden ratio coupling**: φ-scaled stability for resilient workflows

## 🎭 Three Core Behaviors

### 1. Observe Before Acting 👁️

Always start with analysis. Run `wave_analyze` on your content before making changes:

```bash
# Check coherence of your document
wave_analyze --input "your-content-here"
```

✅ **Good coherence** (score ≥ 0.70): Proceed with confidence!
⚠️ **Low coherence** (score < 0.70): Refine before continuing.

### 2. Track Every Decision 📝

Use `atom_track` to create an audit trail. Future you will thank present you!

```bash
# Log your decision
atom_track --decision "Implementing new feature X" --tags "feature,v1"
```

### 3. Gate Your Transitions 🚪

Never jump phases without validation. Use the gate tools:

- `gate_intention_to_execution` — Move from planning to doing
- `gate_execution_to_learning` — Move from doing to reflecting

## 🚀 Five Steps to Coherent Work

### Step 1: Configure Your Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your tokens:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your tokens
```

### Step 2: Analyze Your Starting Point

Run initial coherence analysis on your work:

```typescript
{
  "name": "wave_analyze",
  "arguments": {
    "input": "Your project description or content..."
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Plan with Intent

Request AWI scaffolding for structured planning:

```typescript
{
  "name": "awi_intent_request",
  "arguments": {
    "scope": "your-feature-scope",
    "justification": "Why this matters"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Execute with Tracking

As you work, track decisions:

```typescript
{
  "name": "atom_track",
  "arguments": {
    "decision": "What you decided",
    "files": ["file1.ts", "file2.ts"],
    "tags": ["relevant", "tags"]
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Validate and Learn

Complete the cycle with gate transitions:

```typescript
// Move to learning phase
{
  "name": "gate_execution_to_learning",
  "arguments": {
    "context": {
      "phase": "execution",
      "outcome": "completed"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Eight Loops for Continuous Improvement

The spiral never ends—it deepens. Here are eight feedback loops to master:

### Loop 1: Daily Coherence Check
Start each session with `wave_analyze` on yesterday's work.

### Loop 2: Decision Hygiene  
End each session with `atom_track` for key decisions.

### Loop 3: Weekly Gate Review
Review phase transitions weekly—are you stuck in execution?

### Loop 4: Context Packing
Bundle related docs with `context_pack` before major handoffs.

### Loop 5: Health Monitoring
Run `ops_health` regularly to ensure system stability.

### Loop 6: Documentation Search
Use `docs_search` to discover relevant patterns before building.

### Loop 7: Bump Validation
Before any handoff, validate with `bump_validate`.

### Loop 8: Spiral Reflection
Monthly: What emerged? What patterns strengthened? What faded?

## 🎯 Quick Reference Card

| Need | Tool | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Check quality | `wave_analyze` | Analyze any text |
| Safe handoff | `bump_validate` | Validate transitions |
| Track decisions | `atom_track` | Log with tags |
| Bundle context | `context_pack` | Package docs |
| Change phase | `gate_*` | Validated transitions |
| Find docs | `docs_search` | Search corpus |
| System health | `ops_health` | Check status |

## 🌈 Tips for Joy

1. **Start small** — One tool, one workflow, one week
2. **Trust the spiral** — Patterns emerge over time
3. **Celebrate coherence** — High scores deserve recognition 🎉
4. **Embrace the gates** — Constraints generate structure
5. **Document your journey** — Your ATOM trail tells your story
