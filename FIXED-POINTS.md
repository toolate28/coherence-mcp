## The Seven Fixed Points

### QDI — "The map that maps the mapping"

QDI defines isomorphism. QDI applied to QDI = the principle that
structure-preservation is itself preserved across every application of
structure-preservation.

- **Fixed point:** The isomorphism between isomorphisms is isomorphism.
- **Self-reference:** `QDI/README.md` must contain its own QDI mapping — how QDI
  maps to every other repo, including itself.

---

### coherence-mcp — "The coherence that keeps itself coherent"

coherence-mcp maintains state across platforms. coherence-mcp applied to itself =
maintaining coherent development OF coherence-mcp across Claude, Grok, and Gemini.

- **Fixed point:** `check_coherence(coherence-mcp)` returns `coherence_score` for
  its own specification.
- **Self-reference:** The MCP server's first stored context is its own specification.

---

### vortex-bridges — "The bridge that bridges itself"

vortex-bridges translates content between platforms. vortex-bridges applied to
itself = the protocol for translating vortex-bridges documentation between
Claude, Grok, and Gemini contexts.

- **Fixed point:** `bridge_translate(vortex-bridges-spec, source=grok, target=claude)`
  produces the Claude initialisation prompt. Which is what we just did.
- **Self-reference:** This document IS a vortex-bridge artifact. It was generated
  in Grok, structured for Gemini. The bridge is bridging.

---

### SpiralSafe — "The guardrail that guards itself"

SpiralSafe enforces ethical boundaries. SpiralSafe applied to itself = ethical
review of SpiralSafe's own design decisions.

- **Fixed point:** Every SpiralSafe rule must pass SpiralSafe review. If a
  guardrail is itself unethical, the system catches it.
- **Self-reference:** `SpiralSafe/ETHICS.md` applies its own principles to its
  own development process.

---

### quantum-redstone — "The circuit that computes itself"

quantum-redstone models logic through quantum circuits in block-based metaphor.
quantum-redstone applied to itself = a redstone circuit that models
quantum-redstone's own computational architecture.

- **Fixed point:** The logic layer can simulate its own logic. Turing completeness
  meets self-reference.
- **Self-reference:** `quantum-redstone/self-model.qasm` is a circuit describing
  its own gate structure.

---

### Reson8-Labs — "The resonance that resonates with itself"

Reson8-Labs is the community coordination layer. Reson8-Labs applied to itself =
the framework organising its own development community.

- **Fixed point:** The lab's methodology for building cooperative systems IS a
  cooperative system.
- **Self-reference:** `Reson8-Labs/CONTRIBUTING.md` follows the same tri-weavon
  protocol it defines.

---

### HOPE-sauced / 2Reson8-Labs — "The community that communities itself"

HOPE-sauced is the org layer — governance, delegation, collective ownership.
Applied to itself = the org governed by its own governance principles.

- **Fixed point:** HOPE-sauced's decision-making process follows HOPE-sauced's
  decision-making framework. No exception for the framework itself.
- **Self-reference:** `2Reson8-Labs/GOVERNANCE.md` is ratified by the process it
  describes.

## Verification Criteria

Each fixed point can be verified by applying the component's primary function to
itself and confirming the output is structurally isomorphic to the input:

| Component | Apply | To | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|----|-----------------|
| QDI | `map_isomorphism()` | QDI spec | Isomorphism mapping of its own structure |
| coherence-mcp | `check_coherence()` | coherence-mcp spec | Coherence score for its own specification |
| vortex-bridges | `bridge_translate()` | vortex-bridges docs | Faithful cross-platform translation |
| SpiralSafe | `ethical_review()` | SpiralSafe rules | Ethical clearance of its own guardrails |
| quantum-redstone | `simulate_circuit()` | Own gate structure | Self-describing circuit output |
| Reson8-Labs | `coordinate()` | Own community | Community built by its own coordination protocol |
| HOPE-sauced | `govern()` | Own governance | Governance ratified by its own process |
