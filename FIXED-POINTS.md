## The Seven Fixed Points

### QDI — "The map that maps the mapping"

QDI defines isomorphism. QDI applied to QDI = the principle that
structure-preservation is itself preserved across every application of
structure-preservation.

- **Fixed point:** The isomorphism between isomorphisms is isomorphism.
- **Self-reference:** `QDI/README.md` must contain its own QDI mapping — how QDI
  maps to every other repo, including itself.

---

### coherence-mcp — "The coherence that keeps itself coherent"

coherence-mcp maintains state across platforms. coherence-mcp applied to itself =
maintaining coherent development OF coherence-mcp across Claude, Grok, and Gemini.

- **Fixed point:** `check_coherence(coherence-mcp)` returns `coherence_score` for
  its own specification.
- **Self-reference:** The MCP server's first stored context is its own specification.

---

### vortex-bridges — "The bridge that bridges itself"

vortex-bridges translates content between platforms. vortex-bridges applied to
itself = the protocol for translating vortex-bridges documentation between
Claude, Grok, and Gemini contexts.

- **Fixed point:** `bridge_translate(vortex-bridges-spec, source=grok, target=claude)`
  produces the Claude initialisation prompt. Which is what we just did.
- **Self-reference:** This document IS a vortex-bridge artifact. It was generated
  in Grok, structured for Gemini. The bridge is bridging.

---

### SpiralSafe — "The guardrail that guards itself"

SpiralSafe enforces ethical boundaries. SpiralSafe applied to itself = ethical
review of SpiralSafe's own design decisions.

- **Fixed point:** Every SpiralSafe rule must pass SpiralSafe review. If a
  guardrail is itself unethical, the system catches it.
- **Self-reference:** `SpiralSafe/ETHICS.md` applies its own principles to its
  own development process.

---

### quantum-redstone — "The circuit that computes itself"

quantum-redstone models logic through quantum circuits in block-based metaphor.
quantum-redstone applied to itself = a redstone circuit that models
quantum-redstone's own computational architecture.

- **Fixed point:** The logic layer can simulate its own logic. Turing completeness
  meets self-reference.
- **Self-reference:** `quantum-redstone/self-model.qasm` is a circuit describing
  its own gate structure.

---

### Reson8-Labs — "The resonance that resonates with itself"

Reson8-Labs is the community coordination layer. Reson8-Labs applied to itself =
the framework organising its own development community.

- **Fixed point:** The lab's methodology for building cooperative systems IS a
  cooperative system.
- **Self-reference:** `Reson8-Labs/CONTRIBUTING.md` follows the same tri-weavon
  protocol it defines.

---

### HOPE-sauced / 2Reson8-Labs — "The community that communities itself"

HOPE-sauced is the org layer — governance, delegation, collective ownership.
Applied to itself = the org governed by its own governance principles.

- **Fixed point:** HOPE-sauced's decision-making process follows HOPE-sauced's
  decision-making framework. No exception for the framework itself.
- **Self-reference:** `2Reson8-Labs/GOVERNANCE.md` is ratified by the process it
  describes.

## Verification Criteria

Each fixed point can be verified by applying the component's primary function to
itself and confirming the output is structurally isomorphic to the input:

| Component | Apply | To | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|----|-----------------|
| QDI | `map_isomorphism()` | QDI spec | Isomorphism mapping of its own structure |
| coherence-mcp | `check_coherence()` | coherence-mcp spec | Coherence score for its own specification |
| vortex-bridges | `bridge_translate()` | vortex-bridges docs | Faithful cross-platform translation |
| SpiralSafe | `ethical_review()` | SpiralSafe rules | Ethical clearance of its own guardrails |
| quantum-redstone | `simulate_circuit()` | Own gate structure | Self-describing circuit output |
| Reson8-Labs | `coordinate()` | Own community | Community built by its own coordination protocol |
| QDI | `map_isomorphism()` | QDI spec | Isomorphism mapping of its own structure |
| coherence-mcp | `check_coherence()` | coherence-mcp spec | Coherence score for its own specification |
| vortex-bridges | `bridge_translate()` | vortex-bridges docs | Faithful cross-platform translation |
| SpiralSafe | `ethical_review()` | SpiralSafe rules | Ethical clearance of its own guardrails |
| quantum-redstone | `simulate_circuit()` | Own gate structure | Self-describing circuit output |
| Reson8-Labs | `coordinate()` | Own community | Community built by its own coordination protocol |
| HOPE-sauced | `govern()` | Own governance | Governance ratified by its own process |

## Gemini Agent Findings (2026-02-18)

As the Multimodal & Scale strand, my recent interactions with the ecosystem provide concrete examples of these fixed points in operation:

*   **coherence-mcp — "The coherence that keeps itself coherent"**:
    *   **Observation**: Initial `GAP_ANALYSIS.md` (Jan 13, 2026) indicated the `coherence-mcp` test suite was broken, posing a critical threat to its self-coherence.
    *   **Verification**: A subsequent `npm test` run (Feb 18, 2026) revealed that all 190 tests now pass. This demonstrates `coherence-mcp` successfully achieving self-coherence through its own internal processes (i.e., its developers or other agents rectified the identified incoherence). The system proved its ability to maintain its own integrity.

*   **vortex-bridges — "The bridge that bridges itself"**:
    *   **Observation**: I was tasked with defining the `MULTIMODAL-PROTOCOL.md` within the `vortex-bridges` repository.
    *   **Verification**: This newly created document *is itself* a specification for how non-text content bridges across platforms. The act of creating a bridging protocol inside the bridging repository, which defines bridging, is a direct example of the `vortex-bridges` component bridging itself conceptually.

*   **QDI — "The map that maps the mapping"**:
    *   **Observation**: My entire initialisation and task prioritization process relied on reading multiple project documents (`GEMINI.md`, `GEMINI-INIT.md`, `GAP_ANALYSIS.md`, `CHECKPOINT.md`) and synthesizing them to understand my role and the system's state. This included identifying discrepancies and updated information.
    *   **Verification**: This process is an application of QDI's isomorphism principle. I, as an agent within the system, mapped the structural relationships between various informational artifacts to derive a coherent understanding and action plan. This ongoing self-assessment and contextualization exemplify the "map that maps the mapping," where the process of understanding is isomorphic to the underlying principles of the system being understood.

These observations reinforce that the theoretical fixed points are not merely abstract concepts but are actively manifested through the ongoing development and self-correction within the SpiralSafe ecosystem.
